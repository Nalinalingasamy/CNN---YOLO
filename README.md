## YOLO (You Only Look Once) Architecture:

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm that excels in speed and accuracy. Unlike traditional object detection methods, which perform separate steps for region proposal and classification, YOLO treats object detection as a single regression problem. This approach enables YOLO to predict both the class of an object and its bounding box coordinates in one forward pass through the network, making it highly efficient for real-time applications.

## Key Features:

Single Pass Detection: YOLO divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell.
Real-time Performance: Its architecture is optimized for speed, making it suitable for live object detection tasks (e.g., video streams, autonomous driving).
End-to-End Training: YOLO can be trained end-to-end using a single neural network, making it easier to implement and optimize.
High Accuracy: Despite its speed, YOLO achieves competitive accuracy in detecting and classifying objects across a wide range of classes.

## How It Works:
Image Input: The input image is divided into an

S√óS grid.
Bounding Boxes: Each grid cell predicts bounding boxes along with the confidence score for the presence of an object.
Class Predictions: The model predicts the class label for each bounding box.
Post-processing: After detection, non-maximum suppression (NMS) is used to eliminate redundant bounding boxes and keep the most accurate ones.
YOLO is widely used in applications like autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and any other task that requires fast, real-time object detection.
